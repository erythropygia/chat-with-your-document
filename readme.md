Chat With Your Document is a lightweight app that lets you securely upload files and ask natural language questions about their contents. It runs a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit UI, parses and chunks PDFs/DOCX/TXT/MD via LangChain, embeds them with Sentence-Transformers, stores them in a local ChromaDB vector index, retrieves relevant snippets, and uses an Ollama‑hosted LLM to generate clear, cited answers. Additionally, it supports image search functionality using the erythropygia/turkish-clip-vit-bert model to find relevant images within uploaded documents based on text queries—so you can understand your documents faster, locally.
